# Attio API Notes

This file records the Attio API assumptions the code currently depends on.

Primary docs:

- REST API overview: https://docs.attio.com/rest-api/overview
- Authentication guide: https://docs.attio.com/rest-api/guides/authentication
- OAuth introspection: https://docs.attio.com/docs/oauth/introspect
- Get workspace member: https://docs.attio.com/rest-api/endpoint-reference/workspace-members/get-a-workspace-member

## Authentication

Attio REST API calls use Bearer auth:

```http
Authorization: Bearer <access_token>
```

For this project, the first auth path is a manually provided API key or access token. This fits personal CLI usage and avoids full OAuth app setup until the CLI needs multi-workspace installation.

## Token Introspection

Endpoint:

```http
POST https://app.attio.com/oauth/introspect
```

Used by:

- `atcli auth` to validate a token before storing it.
- `atcli whoami` to identify the authenticated workspace.

Fields currently modeled:

- `active`
- `scope`
- `token_type`
- `workspace_id`
- `workspace_name`
- `workspace_slug`
- `authorized_by_workspace_member_id`

## Workspace Member Lookup

Endpoint:

```http
GET https://api.attio.com/v2/workspace_members/{workspace_member_id}
```

Used by:

- `atcli whoami` when introspection provides `authorized_by_workspace_member_id`.

Fields currently modeled:

- `id.workspace_member_id`
- `first_name`
- `last_name`
- `email_address`
- `access_level`

This lookup may require `user_management:read`. If the token lacks permission, `whoami` should still print workspace/token details and report that member details are unavailable.
